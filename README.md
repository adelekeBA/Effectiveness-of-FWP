üîç Context:
‚ÄúEffectiveness of Flexible Working Practices on Organisational Productivity: Employers‚Äô Perceptions in the UK‚Äù Analysed secondary data from the Fourth Work-Life Balance Survey of Employers (WLB4) to examine how flexible working practices (FWPs) influence organisational productivity, with employee behaviours as mediating factors.

üí° Tasks:
Collected, cleaned and transformed data to extract a focused subset of 1,388 observations from profit-driven organisations. Conducted descriptive and exploratory statistical analysis to identify initial patterns. Built and validated an ordinal logistic regression model to assess the relationship between FWPs and productivity. Developed decision tree and random forest models to predict productivity based on FWPs and behavioural variables (motivation, turnover, absenteeism). Applied feature importance analysis to determine key predictors of productivity. Interpreted findings through the lens of Contingency Theory.

üìà Key Outcomes:
Demonstrated that FWPs enhance productivity, primarily through reduced turnover and absenteeism, and increased employee motivation. Found that medium-sized firms benefit more from FWPs than small businesses. Highlighted the significance of role suitability and formal flexible working policies in influencing outcomes. Strengthened skills in predictive modelling, regression analysis, and data visualisation using R. Gained hands-on experience in applying quantitative methods to real-world organisational data.

üß∞ Tools & Techniques:
Excel, RStudio, R (ggplot2, randomForest, ordinal), CART, random forest, ordinal logistic regression, Pearson correlation analysis.
