# 📘 Effectiveness of Flexible Working Practices (FWPs)  
**Impact of Flexible Working on Organisational Productivity in the UK**

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project analysed secondary data from the **Fourth Work-Life Balance Survey of Employers (WLB4)** to examine how **Flexible Working Practices (FWPs)** influence organisational productivity in UK profit-driven businesses. The analysis explored employee behaviours such as **motivation**, **turnover**, and **absenteeism** as mediating factors, using both classical and machine learning methods.

## 💡 Objectives & Tasks

- Extracted and cleaned a subset of **1,388 records** from profit-oriented organisations
- Conducted **descriptive** and **exploratory statistical analysis** to identify trends and relationships
- Built and validated an **ordinal logistic regression model** to assess the link between FWPs and productivity
- Developed **decision tree** and **random forest models** to predict productivity using FWPs and behavioural variables
- Performed **feature importance analysis** to identify the most impactful predictors
- Interpreted findings using **Contingency Theory** to understand context-dependent results

---

## 📈 Key Findings

- **FWPs significantly enhance productivity**, largely by:
  - Reducing staff turnover and absenteeism
  - Increasing employee motivation
- **Medium-sized firms** benefit more than smaller firms from FWPs
- **Role suitability** and presence of **formal flexible working policies** are critical to achieving productivity gains
- Demonstrated the practical value of combining **statistical modelling** with **machine learning** in organisational research
